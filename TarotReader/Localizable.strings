"Help.Description" = "I’m so happy to share this beautiful card deck with you.\n\nIt’s a great way to offer any problem to Love and be freed from the stress of the ego forcing solutions. Anyone can learn to invite this Force to take over fully.\n\nSo ask your intuition to show You the best way to use these cards. They can be an oracle for a specific problem, or simply connect you in the moment to the Divine.  When you open fully, the Way for You will be shown.\n\nWhen you first enter deck, take a moment, close your eyes, and either let a question or thought come into your mind, or free your mind from all thoughts. Then tap the back of a card. A prayer will be shown. To explore other prayers, simply swipe left or right.\n\nWhen we invoke the Divine to “shift” us, we invite the Highest part of OURSELVES to take over. After all, It’s everything, inside, outside, all of it.\n\nFor more help going deeper into this holy unfolding, read or hear the Change Me Prayer book that these are based on.\n\nI hope you receive much joy from these cards!\n\nLove,\nTosha";
