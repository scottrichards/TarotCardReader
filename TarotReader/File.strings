"Help.Description" = "I'm so happy to share this beautiful card deck with you. \nIt's a great way to offer any problem to Love and be freed from the stress of the ego forcing solutions. Anyone can learn to invite this Force to take over fully.\n\nSo ask your intuition to show You the best way to use these cards. They can be an oracle for a specific problem, or simply connect you in the moment to the Divine. You can even carry one with you as a sacred reminder. When you open fully, the Way for You will be shown.\n\n";
